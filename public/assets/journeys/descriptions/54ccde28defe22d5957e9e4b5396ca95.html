We needed a pumpkin and a day of family fun, since Monday was a day off from school, so we went to check out the Pumpkin Patch Farm. Here, we all rode the hayride, while Christian had fun on the jumping pillow, a horse ride and their 40-foot zipline. Ended the fun visit with a challenging maze, where we had to locate 12 creepy Halloween characters within the maze.
